## Quick start and develop

Quick start [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) app.

Prepare environment for React Native and:

1. Clone the project;
2. Install node_modules: `cd connectycube-reactnative-samples/RNVideoChat && npm install`;
3. Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

## Running on a device

The above command will automatically run your app on the iOS Simulator by default. If you want to run the app on an actual physical iOS device, please follow the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device).

## Build your own VideoChat app

To make the sample works for your own app, please do the following:

1.  Register new account and application at `https://admin.connectycube.com` and then put Application credentials from 'Overview' page into `src/config.js` file:

    ```javascript
    export const credentials = {
      appId: 0,
      authKey: "",
      authSecret: ""
    };
    ```

2.  At `https://admin.connectycube.com`, create from 2 to 4 users in 'Users' module and put them into `src/config.js` file:

    ```javascript
    export const users = [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "User1",
        login: "videouser1",
        password: "videouser1",
        color: "#34ad86"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "User2",
        login: "videouser2",
        password: "videouser2",
        color: "#077988"
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: "User3",
        login: "videouser3",
        password: "videouser3",
        color: "#13aaae"
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        name: "User4",
        login: "videouser4",
        password: "videouser4",
        color: "#056a96"
      }
    ];
    ```

3.  (Optional) If you are at [Enterprise](https://connectycube.com/pricing/) plan - provide your API server and Chat server endpoints at `src/config.js` file to point the sample against your own server:

    ```javascript
    {
       endpoints: {
           api: "",
           chat: ""
       },
       ...
    };
    ```

4. Install node modules - `npm install`
5. Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.
